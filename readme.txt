To operate this program, it must be run on a server capable of running PHP. An 
Apache server is the device that the program was tested on. 

To begin, load up the main landing page (index.php) and choose the Sign Up option. 
Once there, enter the required information. The form should notify you if you miss a field, 
or if your password entries do not match. Once creation is successful you will be reouted to your
user secific dashboard, where you can choose to Create an Event, Logout, or view your owned events.

Click the Logout button the log out of the system. You will be taken back to the landing page. Log in 
using the email/password credentials you entered when signing up. You will be taken back to your dashboard.

To create an event, click on the Create Event button. You will be taken to a form where you can provide
required details about the event. Once the information is enter and Submit is clicked, you will be taken back
to your dashboard where the newly created event should show under My Events.

Click Logout to logout of the system. The system should then prevent you from accessing the dashboard
page again unless you log back in (for example, by hitting the back button on your browser). Note that
this feature has not been fully implemented/tested.
